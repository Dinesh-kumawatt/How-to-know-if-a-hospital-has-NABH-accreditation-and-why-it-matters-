# How-to-know-if-a-hospital-has-NABH-accreditation-and-why-it-matters-

NABH is like a “quality badge” for hospitals in India. It stands for National Accreditation Board for Hospitals, and only hospitals that follow strict rules in patient safety, hygiene, treatment, and ethics get this tag.

If a hospital is NABH-accredited, it means it’s regularly audited and follows Indian and international standards. You can usually find this info on their website, reception area or medical certificate board.

Care and Cure Hospital in Ahmedabad proudly carries this tag – which shows their commitment to safe and ethical care.

So next time you visit a hospital, just ask: “Are you NABH certified?” It’s your right to know.
